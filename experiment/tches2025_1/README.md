# About

This folder contains the additional data for tches 2025_1 submission (comparing to tches 2024_4 submission).

For comparing four tools, we included the time for elaborating ROBDD.

The verification procedure of SILVER and Prover including:

  - Parsing
  - Elaboration
  - Verification

In our previous submissions, we only compared SILVER and Prover. And for convenience, we only compared the verification time of SILVER and Prover, excluding the Parsing time and Elaboration time.

If we do so when comparing with CocoAlma and maskVerif, it would be a little unfair since we omits the parsing and elaboration time. So in our submission for tches 2025_1, we have included the elaboration time when comparing to coco and maskVerif. We did not include the parsing time since we did not have enough time to get the timing data. So it is a little unfair comparing to CocoAlma and maskVerif, although we believe it would not affect the conclusion.
